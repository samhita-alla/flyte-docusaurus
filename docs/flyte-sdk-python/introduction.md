title: Introduction
---

These tutorials are intended to help the user learn by example. We start with various concepts in flyte and flytekit with examples and then introduce some of the core plugins. This cookbook is designed to get you running both locally, and on a Flyte cluster using [Flytekit Python](https://github.com/lyft/flytekit).

All the examples are authored using Flytekit Python and are designed to be run-locally (this may not be possible for some plugins) or on a Flyte cluster.
